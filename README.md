• Basic Formatting:
I adjusted column widths for better readability, applied distinct header formatting with appropriate colors, and added borders to clearly separate the header row from the data.
• Filtering and Segmentation:
I filtered the dataset based on customer segments and created separate worksheets for each one. I then extracted and worked specifically on the Corporate segment for all analysis and reporting tasks.
• Report Preparation – I:
To enhance readability, I froze the header row, removed/hid unnecessary columns, and standardized numerical formats. Sales and profit values were rounded to one decimal place and formatted in USD. Date columns were also reformatted into a user-friendly format.
• Report Preparation – II (Sorting & Conditional Formatting):
I organized the Corporate data hierarchically — sorted by Region, then Province, then descending Sales. I used conditional formatting to highlight the top 10% sales orders in each province and visually mapped profits and losses using color gradients (green for high profits, red for high losses).
• Report Preparation – III:
I visually demarcated each Region using double bottom borders to make the report more scannable and presentation-ready.
• Pivot Table Analysis – High-Profit Categories:
I built a pivot table to identify the top 3 most profitable sub-categories in each region. This helped reveal which product types are consistently profitable across geographies.
• Pivot Table Analysis – Loss-Making Categories:
I further analyzed the data to uncover the least profitable sub-categories and pinpointed the specific regions contributing to the losses. This exercise provided valuable insights into areas for cost reduction or product strategy revision.
• Insight-Driven Decision Support:
The combination of structured formatting, filtering, and profitability analysis helped me generate a clean, interactive, and insightful report — one that can be readily used by management to make data-backed decisions.
